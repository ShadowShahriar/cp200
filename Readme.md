# CP 200: A Tale of Failure

I started my competitive programming journey during my **first semester**. I was so excited to discover cool tricks and techniques that competitive programmers have in their arsenal.

However, due to many events (some being ‚ú®**life-changing**‚ú®), I could not continue. In fact, I restarted my journey during my **second semester**. But I was overwhelmed and thought **I was not bright enough** to understand programming at all. I was lost that **I had successfully wasted my first year**.

Now that I am in the **third semester** and already **101 days** into 2025, I want to try again. Maybe, just maybe, I will get better at it.

**Duration:** 3 days (**from 12 Apr 2025 to 14 Apr 2025**)

**Problems Solved:** 7 (C: **1**, C++: **6**)

**Contests Joined:** 0
